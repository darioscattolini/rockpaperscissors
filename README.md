# Rock, Paper, Scissors
> A simple, straightforward Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer. 

## General info
This is the first JavaScript app I developed, in September 2019, when I'd had enough with core JavaScript kata exercises and started working on closer to real projects, DOM manipulation and event handling.
The mechanics of both the game and the code is simple: the user chooses her play, which triggers a randomly generated computer play; the script then compares both plays and displays the result. The user can click anywhere on the page to clear the game and play again.

## Latest update
In December 2019, by then more familiar with best practices, I improved the code in order to include the project in my portfolio. The main changes where:
* Added README.md file.
* Added LICENCE.txt file.
* Added more detailed and consistent comments in main.js.
* Made minor refactoring of JS code.
* Removed remnants of unnecessary boilerplate for HTML and CSS files added at the beginning of development.
* Corrected bugs in fluid layout making the app (almost) fully responsive.
* Locked layout in landscape mode for mobile devices (a vertical display would had been a better responsive solution, but I wanted to achieve the former effect).

## Built with
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (ES6)

## Status
_finished_
There are no features to add to the project. 
I have two related ideas which are not extensions but projects on their own: 
* developing a multiplayer version, and
* making use of the UI to test machine learning algorithms a friend of mine is developing.

## Inspiration
I found the idea for this project in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s wonderful curriculum.
