# Rock, Paper, Scissors
> A simple, straightforward Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer. 

## General info
This is the first JavaScript app I developed, in September 2019, when I'd had enough with core JavaScript kata exercises and started working on closer to real projects, DOM manipulation and event handling.
The mechanics of both the game and the code is simple: the user chooses her play, which triggers a randomly generated computer play; the script then compares both plays and displays the result. The user can click anywhere on the page to clear the game and play again.

## Latest update
In October 2020 I made a major refactoring of the code. The main changes were:
* Preload all images to smooth the transition between them.
* Adopted a more object-oriented approach.
* Game result is calculated arithmetically (and not through case by case comparison).
* Improved the layout with CSS transitions displaying the game result.
* Added a counter to keep track of game results.

## Built with
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (ES6)

## Status
_under development_
I intend to add a multiplayer version.
